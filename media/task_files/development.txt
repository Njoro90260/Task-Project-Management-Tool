Since you're developing a **Task/Project Management Tool** with a **Kanban board** and various features, here's an **optimal order** to implement them based on dependencies and complexity:  

---

### **Phase 1: Core Task & Project Management**
1. **Project Management** â€“ Create the `Project` model, implement project creation, assignment, deadlines, and team management.  
2. **Task Management** â€“ Develop the `Task` model with attributes like title, description, priority, status, start date, and due date.  
3. **Task Prioritization** â€“ Add a priority field (`High`, `Medium`, `Low`) and allow sorting/filtering based on priority.  
4. **Kanban Board** â€“ Implement the Kanban board for task visualization (drag-and-drop functionality).  

---

### **Phase 2: Team & User Features**
5. **User Management** â€“ Implement user registration, login, roles, and project-specific permissions.  
6. **Role-based Permissions** â€“ Define user roles (Admin, Manager, Team Member) and restrict access to functionalities accordingly.  
7. **Team Collaboration** â€“ Add comments and file-sharing capabilities within tasks.  

---

### **Phase 3: Enhancing Task & Project Execution**
8. **Time Tracking** â€“ Implement task-level time logging for users.  
9. **Recurring Tasks** â€“ Add support for automatically repeating tasks on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.  
10. **Search & Filters** â€“ Enable searching for tasks, projects, and users with filters for status, priority, and deadlines.  
11. **Notifications & Alerts** â€“ Implement real-time notifications for task updates, due dates, and team mentions.  

---

### **Phase 4: Integrations & Advanced Features**
12. **Calendar Integration** â€“ Sync tasks and deadlines with Google Calendar or other calendar services.  
13. **External Integrations** â€“ Connect with Slack, Google Drive, Trello, or GitHub for extended functionality.  
14. **File Sharing** â€“ Allow users to upload and share files within tasks and projects.  

---

### **Phase 5: Reporting & Customization**
15. **Progress Tracking** â€“ Add a **Gantt chart** or **progress bar** to monitor task and project status.  
16. **Reports & Analytics** â€“ Generate reports on task completion, team productivity, and project health.  
17. **Customizable Dashboards** â€“ Let users personalize their dashboard with key project metrics.  
18. **Project Timeline** â€“ Implement a timeline view for tracking project phases and milestones.  

---

### **Final Phase: Testing & Deployment**
19. **Comprehensive Testing** â€“ Perform unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing.  
20. **Performance Optimization** â€“ Optimize queries, caching, and load times for smooth user experience.  
21. **Deployment & Documentation** â€“ Deploy to production and write user documentation.  

---

### **Why This Order?**
- **Core features** come first to ensure project and task management are functional.  
- **User roles & collaboration** follow to enable teamwork.  
- **Enhancements & automation** improve usability and efficiency.  
- **Integrations & reporting** add advanced capabilities.  
- **Customization & polish** ensure a refined final product.
